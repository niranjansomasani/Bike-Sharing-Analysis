# Bike-Sharing-Analysis

This dataset is from Kaggle competition.
It has train and test datasets.

I've created two python notebook files

Analysis: This has an extensive analysis of each of the different attributes, their correlations, importance, data types, feature engineering, 
data visualization, grouping range of values in each column as appropriate etc.,
Ideal for those who wants to dig into the dataset and aren't familiar with the data before and want to start from data preprocessing to applying models.

DiffModels: This notebook has just a basic data preprocessing and feature engineering but more emphasis on different models and how can they be evaluated and improve performance.
Best start for someone who are familiar with the dataset and don't want to dig into analysis of different attributes and their relationships. 
Ideal for those who puts more emphasis on building models, tuning parameters to improve model performance and evaluate different models.

For ML starters, I'd recommend going through 'Analysis' notebook file first to understand how the basic data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, scaling, data visualization
and transforming data appropriate to the model you want to apply and then 'DiffModels' notebook to get a glance of different model performances, evaluating performace using k-fold cross validation, paramater tuning using Gridsearch.

As we don't have the results for test dataset, we can't evaluate the model performance. But as we need to evaluate on some data to improve, tune parameters of model, I've used only training data and split it into train, test in 'DiffModels' notebook file. 'Analysis' file explores both the train, test data.

I'm open to learn from each other and woule be more than happy to receive your feedback.
Happy Learning!
